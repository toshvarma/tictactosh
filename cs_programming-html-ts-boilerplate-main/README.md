# CS Programming | HTML and TypeScript Boilerplate

## On first run
Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

## Editing 
All files should be edited in the `src` folder. The `build` folder is generated by the build process and should not be edited directly.

Add new HTML, CSS, and TypeScript files to the `src` folder as needed.

## Bundling
To start the bundle process, run `npm run build`. This will create a `build` folder with the bundled files.

If you want to run the bundle process in watch mode, run `npm run build:watch`.

## Viewing the HTML files
To view the HTML files, open the `build` folder and open the desired HTML file in a browser. E.g., by right-clicking the file and selecting "Open with" and then your browser of choice.
